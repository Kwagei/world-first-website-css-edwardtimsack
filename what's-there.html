    <h1>General Overview</h1>
    <p>
        There is no "top" to the World-Wide Web. You can look at it from many points of view. If you have no other bias, here are some ways of looking for information. <br>
        <br>
        <a href="by Subject">by Subject</a> <br>
        A classification by subject of interest. Incomplete but easiest to use. <br>
        <a href="by Type">by type</a> <br>
        Looking by type of service (access protocol, etc) may allow to find things if you know what you are looking for. <br>
        <br>

        If you have to use a "top" node, we recommend either this node or the subject list. See also: <a href="About the W3 project">About the W3 project</a>.
